# Homework

## Assignments
Coming soon!

## Homework deadlines and late submissions

Homework deadlines will be announced early in the quarter to enable you to effectively plan and balance your academic work and other commitments. Despite the best planning, however, we know that life happens! So:

- You are permitted 4 "late days" for your assignments. In other words, there would be no penalty if you submitted one of the assignments four days late, or two of the assignments two days late, etc.
- Beyond that, your grade for an assignment goes down by 7 points (e.g., 90% to 83%) for every 12 hours the assignment is late, up until a week after the deadline, at which point the assignment will receive a grade of 0%.
