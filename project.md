# Course project

All students in the class will write a "mini-paper" as a final project, which can be empirical, theoretical, or both. Students should write up the results in the [NeurIPS conference format](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).

## Working in groups
- Students are welcome to work in groups on the final project.
- Groups should include at most three students (except with special permission).
- I will expect a group of two students to put twice as much work into the final project than for a sole-author project, and similarly for groups of three.
- Students in groups are required to include a “contributions” paragraph in their paper that concretely lists each author's contributions.
- The paper length for a final project write-up is 3 + n where n is the number of people in the group that worked on the project, not including references or the contributions paragraph.

## Milestones
- **April 17-21**: All groups will meet with the instructor to discuss project ideas. Please come prepared with ideas/interests! Look out for an email about scheduling this meeting.
- **May 5**: Each group will submit a short progress report of 1-2 pages. Describe your project and partial progress.
- **May 11**: Each group will give a short presentation in class about a paper related to their project.
- **June 8**: Students will present their final project during class.
- **June 12**: Each group will submit their final report.

## Grading
- **Progress report**: 7 points.
- **Midterm presentation**: 8 points.
- **Novelty**: 5 points; your project should propose something new (either a new application, method, or perspective).
- **Writing**: 10 points; your final paper should be readable and complete and situate itself appropriately among related work.
- **Final presentation**: 10 points; your final project presentation should be clear and provide a solid picture of what you did.
