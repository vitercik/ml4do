# Machine Learning for Discrete Optimization

## Course information

- **Quarter:** Spring 2024
- **Lecture time:** Mondays and Wednesdays 1:30-2:50pm
- **Lecture location:** 200-203
- **Instructor:** [Ellen Vitercik](https://vitercik.github.io)
- **Instructor office hours:** TBD
- **Prerequisites:** Introductory course in algorithms (e.g., CS 161) and introductory course in machine learning (e.g., CS 229).

## Description

Machine learning has become a powerful tool for discrete optimization. This is because, in practice, we often have ample data about the application domain?data that can be used to optimize algorithmic performance, ranging from runtime to solution quality. This course covers how machine learning can be used within the discrete optimization pipeline from many perspectives, including how to design novel combinatorial algorithms with machine-learned modules and configure existing algorithms' parameters to optimize performance. Topics will include both applied machinery (such as graph neural networks and reinforcement learning) as well as theoretical tools for providing provable guarantees.

## Course activities

- **[Lectures](schedule.md):** The course will include lectures which cover key technical tools used to develop and analyze machine learning approaches to discrete optimization.
- **[Homework](homework.md):** There will be three homeworks that include both applied coding problems (in Python) and theoretical exercises.
- **[Project](project.md):** Students will complete a course project, in a group or individually.

## Grading

Grading will be out of 100 points. The grading breakdowns are as follows:
- **[Homeworks](https://vitercik.github.io/ml4algs/homeworks):** 60 points
- **[Project](https://vitercik.github.io/ml4algs/project/#grading):** 40 points
