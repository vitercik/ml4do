# Additional course policies

## Presence and participation

Class participation is important for staying engaged and in sync with the course material. Although lectures will be recorded, attending in person is encouraged through our participation policy:

- In-class participation will be recorded using in-class polls on the Poll Everywhere website. **It is necessary that you log in using your SUNet credentials.** Go to [Pollev.stanford.edu](http://pollev.stanford.edu/) and log in with your SUNet credentials to access your free account. Or enter your SUNet email address at [Polleverywhere.com](http://polleverywhere.com/) and click Log in with Stanford to enter through the SUNet portal.
- If you cannot make it to class, you can watch the lecture recording, which will be posted after the lecture on Canvas, and submit a 100-word summary of what was covered. You must upload this summary to Canvas before the start of the next class.
- You get 2 ‘passes’ to be absent from class, no class summary necessary, and no questions asked.

## The honor code

You will be evaluated in this course as an individual and are expected to cite sources and individuals from whom you have learned and borrowed as a display of academic, intellectual, and creative integrity. Failure to do so is a violation of Stanford’s Honor Code and is a serious offense, even when the violation is unintentional. Conduct prohibited by the Honor Code includes all forms of academic dishonesty, among them representing others’ work as one’s own. Please review [Stanford’s Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-guidance/honor-code), and when in doubt, contact Ellen.

## Extended absences

Despite our efforts to take precautions and protect ourselves and those around us, it is possible that one or more of us in the class will get sick, will need to give care to someone sick, or for other reasons will require an extended absence during the quarter.
- If a student requires an extended absence before more than 70% of coursework is completed, there might be opportunities to Withdraw from the course, or develop a schedule for making up and submitting coursework later in the quarter. Students in this situation should talk to a staff member at the [Office of Accessible Education](https://oae.stanford.edu/students) and to Ellen as soon as possible.
- If a student requires an extended absence after at least 70% of coursework is completed at a passing grade or higher, students may request an [Incomplete](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/evaluations-exams-grades/grades/general-university-grading-system#incomplete-grades). Incompletes do not award any credit and can drop students below the minimum required unit load. This could negatively impact academic progress, graduation, NCAA and Veteran’s certifications, and financial aid. Students in this situation should talk to Ellen to discuss options.

## Course privacy statement

As noted in the university’s [recording and broadcasting courses policy](https://bulletin.stanford.edu/academic-polices/courses/recording-lectures), students may not audio or video record class meetings without permission from the instructor (and guest speakers, when applicable). Students may keep the recordings posted on Canvas only for personal use and may not post recordings on the Internet, or otherwise distribute them. These policies protect the privacy rights of instructors and students, and the intellectual property and other rights of the university. Students who need lectures recorded for the purposes of an academic accommodation should contact the [Office of Accessible Education](https://oae.stanford.edu/students).

## Academic accommodations

Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and essential part of the Stanford community. We welcome you to our class.

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services, please visit [oae.stanford.edu](oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience of this course.

Students who are immunocompromised should register with the OAE as soon as possible.

Student athletes who anticipate challenges in being able to participate in class or submit assignments on time should speak to a course instructor or teaching assistant as soon as possible about available alternatives or allowances.
